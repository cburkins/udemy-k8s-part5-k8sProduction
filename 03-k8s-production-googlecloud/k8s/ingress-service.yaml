spec:

        # You can inspect via "kubectl describe secrets/secret-name"
        # Referencing this secret here tells Ingress controller to secure comms from client to Load Balancer using TLS
        # You must make sure this TLS secret came form a certificate that contains a Common Name (CN), also known as FQDN
        - secretName: udemy-k8s-01 # will be in "default" namespace

    #     - hosts:
